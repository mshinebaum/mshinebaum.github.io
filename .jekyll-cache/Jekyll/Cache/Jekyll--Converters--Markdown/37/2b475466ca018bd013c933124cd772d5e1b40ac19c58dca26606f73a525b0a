I"î<p>Hi there.</p>

<p>My name is Martin.
I am the owner and Chief Software developer of Lux and Arbor, and I did not take the direct route to get here.
I originally qualified as a Pharmacist at Aston University in 2003. From there I spen a number of years as a Community
Pharmacy manaager for the Co-operative, before the opportunity to purchase a small number of pharmacies made itself available.
I worked as owner operator of those sites ofr 10 years until the gradual erosion of pharmacy funding led me to decide that
my time was most likely spent in other pursuits.</p>

<p>Since I was small my downtime was spent obsessed with technology, by the age of 5 I had dismantled my first VHS recorder,
which remained working even after re-assembly.</p>
