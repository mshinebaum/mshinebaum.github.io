I"<p>Hi there.</p>

<p>My name is Martin.
I am the owner and Chief Software developer of Lux and Arbor, and I did not take the direct route to get here.
I originally qualified as a Pharmacist at Aston University in 2003. From there I spent a number of years as a Community
Pharmacy manaager for the Co-operative, before the opportunity to purchase a small number of pharmacies made itself available.
I worked as owner operator of those sites ofr 10 years until the gradual erosion of pharmacy funding led me to decide that
my time was most likely spent in other pursuits.</p>

<p>Since I was small my downtime was spent obsessed with technology, by the age of 5 I had dismantled my first VHS recorder,
which remained working even after re-assembly. My true passion though was always computing. From the early days of the
Spectrum ZX81 with its rubber keys, through a Commodore 64, Amstrad 128, Amiga 500 to the early days of the pentium PCs. Now 
to the modern day computing landscape of Intel, AMD and Apple systems, combined with the mobile achitechtures of iOS and Android.</p>

<p>Never has there been so much scope for companies to reach greater markets and cutomer bases than right now. With the right software
ecosystems behind you the sky is quite literally the limit (just ask Elon). My job now i</p>
